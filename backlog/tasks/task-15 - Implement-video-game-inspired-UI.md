## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the UI specification defined in docs/ui-spec.md. The interface should feel like commanding a war council in a fantasy RPG - ornate but readable, stylized but functional. Key elements include ornate panel frames with decorative corners, beveled game-style buttons, glowing status indicators, agent identity system with sigils and colors, and subtle animations.
